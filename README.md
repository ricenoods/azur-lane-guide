### General Interface

1. #### Shops

    - Shops are where you can purchase skins, gems, and other resources.
    - Always try to pick up discounted cubes and T3 skill books from the General Shop. Gold boxes should only be bought with an excess of coins.
    - The guild shop sells important items such as retrofit blueprints and can be a good supplier of crafting parts.
    - Tip: Tap on Akashi twice a day for some bonus rewards.

2. Dock

    - This is where all your ship-girls are found.
    - You can equip/level/retrofit your ships here.
    - Note: Dock space will eventually be a limiting factor (need gems to expand dock).

3. Depot

    - Here you will craft, upgrade, and manage your item inventory.
    - Blueprints for crafting gear can be found through farming or research.

4. Lab

    - See the Research section.

5. Missions

    - Here you will find your daily/weekly/event missions.
    - Missions will reward you with coins, oils, bulins, and other resources.
    - Try to do at least the dailies.

6. Building

    - The build menu is split into Event, Light, Heavy, and Special Tabs.
    - The Event tab will not be available if there is no ongoing event.
    - Each ship has a specific build time which can be viewed at the bottom of this [page](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Building).
    - The Exchange menu allows you to trade in 'Medals of Honor' for ships and crafting resources.
    - It is recommended to only retire duplicate ships (i.e. you have already obtained the needed number for max limit breaking).

7. Guild
    - The public guild is available by default to all new players.
    - For fellow Fobbits, we have a guild on the Amagi server (info in discord).
    - Here you can earn fleet currency to spend at the guild shop.
