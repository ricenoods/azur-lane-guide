## General Interface

### Profile

- This is the chibi icon in the top left.
- Your chosen secretarie(s) will gain 1 point of affinity every 300-320 minutes. Secretary affinity gain stops at 90 affinity.

### Shop

- Shops are where you can purchase skins, gems, and other resources.
- Always try to pick up discounted cubes and T3 skill books from the General Shop. Gold boxes should only be bought with an excess of coins.
- The guild shop sells important items such as retrofit blueprints and can be a good supplier of crafting parts.
- **Tip**: Tap on Akashi twice a day for some bonus rewards.

### Dock

- This is where all your ship-girls are found.
- You can equip/level/retrofit your ships here.
- Note: Dock space will eventually be a limiting factor (need gems to expand dock).

### Depot

- Here you will craft, upgrade, and manage your item inventory.
- Blueprints for crafting gear can be found through farming or research.

### Lab

- See the [Research](#research) section.

### Missions

- Here you will find your daily/weekly/event missions.
- Missions will reward you with coins, oils, bulins, and other resources.
- Try to do at least the dailies each day.

### Building

- The build menu is split into Event, Light, Heavy, and Special Tabs.
- The Event tab will not be available if there is no ongoing event.
- Each ship has a specific build time which can be viewed at the bottom of this [page](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Building).
- It is not necessary to use Quick Finishers unless you want to use 10-pulls during events.
- The Exchange menu allows you to trade in **Medals of Honor** for ships and crafting resources.
    * It is recommended to only retire duplicate ships (i.e. you have already obtained the needed number for max limit breaking).
    * Keep at least 80 **Medals of Honor** in order to exchange for the SR on rotation.
    * Always buy the gold Bulin if it appears in the shop.
    * Buy retrofit blueprints if needed. Many players end up with a shortage of destroyer (DD) blueprints since there are many good destroyers that can be retrofitted.

### Guild

- The public guild is available by default to all new players.
- For fellow Fobbits, we have a guild on the Amagi server (info in discord).
- Here you can earn fleet currency (3x per day) to spend at the guild shop.

## Mechanics

### Formation

- Main Fleet: Backline
    * **Aircraft Carriers (CV, CVL)**: Clears the screen of enemy projectiles and weaker ships
    * **Airspace Control Value (ACV)**: Improves damage dealt by your carriers and reduces hostile encounters.
    * **Battleships, Battlecruisers (BB, BC, BBV, BM)**: Uses barrage damage for high-value targets while secondary guns protects rest of backline from suicide ships.
- Vanguard Fleet: Frontline
    * **Destroyers (DD)**: Uses high-damage torpedoes and has high evasion/speed to move your fleet faster. Suffers from weak gun damage and low HP stats.
    * **Light Cruisers (CL)**: Balanced  ships with good stats and high anti-air capability.
    * **Heavy Cruisers (CA, CB)**: Has high damage and/or large HP pool. Can be expensive.
- Battle Formation
    * Single-Line Assault: Increases Firepower and Torpedo by 15%, but reduces Evasion by 10% (Applies only to Vanguard fleet).
    * Double-Line Advance: Increases Evasion by 30%, but decreases Firepower and Torpedo by 5% (Applies only to Vanguard fleet). 
    * Circular Defense: Increases Anti-Air by 20% (no penalties, applies to entire fleet).
- Tips
    * For the frontline, put your tankiest ship on the left and second-tankiest on the left.
    * Keep your strongest ship in the middle (flagship position) especially to improve the centering and targeting of a powerful barrage skill.
    * Some ships grant support buffs for certain hull classes or factions. Make sure your ships can synergize well.
    * Two fleets are recommended to clear harder stages: mob fleet and boss fleet.

### Stage-Clearing

- Azur Lane can be played in manual or auto mode (manual is recommended for harder stages).
- Each map has a **Danger Level** mechanic:
    * **Danger Level** can either be denoted by level, or by maximum threat (Lethal) to minimum threat (Safe).
    * Ship levels are critical to easily winning battles. Each level difference results in a 2% increased damage and 2% reduced damage taken buff for your fleet (capped at 50%).
    * The ship level buffs will also apply to enemy fleets (to your detriment). 
- Each fleet begins with 5 Ammo and will consume 1 Ammo each battle. 
    * If you run out of Ammo, your fleet will deal 50% less damage. 
    * Maps may have nodes which can replenish fleet Ammo.
- Enemies will appear on the map with different strength indicators.
    * Standard mobs will need to be cleared in order to spawn the boss.
    * Defeating the boss (flagship fleet) is required to clear the map.
- 100% Clear 
    * In order to 100% clear a map, you need to defeat the boss a certain number of times (varies per map).
    * **Clearing Mode** is unlocked at 100% clear (auto-movement for fleets).
- 3-Stars
    * In order to 3-star a map, you need to complete the 3 listed objectives.
- Always get an S-Rank, as you are guaranteed drops by an S-rank.

### Hard Mode

- Hard Mode stages reward Retrofit blueprints and Core Data.
- Only 3 Hard Mode map clears are available each day.
- Once a map has reached 100%, **Clearing Mode** is unlocked. In **Clearing Mode** only the boss will spawn.
- Requirements to enter maps:
    * The average level of ships used is greater than the required average.
    * At least one of the ship class requirements per fleet is met. For this requirement, Main and Vanguard fleets are accounted for separately.
    * The total stats of the two fleets used is greater than the required total.
- Each Hard Mode node will spawn drop different retrofit blueprints:
    * X-1 drops destroyer.
    * X-2 drops cruiser.
    * X-3 drops battleship.
    * X-4 drops carrier.

### Gear

- How do you get gear? 
    * Crafting with blueprints (obtained from map clears).
    * Opening gear boxes.
    * Completing (non-repeatable) starter missions.
- Never ever open white (T1) or blue (T2) boxes. Instead, use lower-tier boxes to craft purple (T3 boxes) for the best odds. White gear can be safely disassembled.
- Gear Enhancement
    * For beginners, enhance blue gear up to +3 (only enhance further if you have surplus of parts).
    * Save crafting resources for purple/gold gear.

### Limit Breaks

- Limit breaks allow you to ascend beyond the level cap of 70 and gives you stat boosts and power.
- Each limit break rank is unlocked at levels 10/30/70 and require duplicate ships or Bulins.
- It is recommended to limit break when your ships are approaching a level cap to avoid EXP loss.
- Note: Limit-breaking will increase your ship's oil cost (may cut into farming efficiency).

### Enhancement

- Enhancement allows you to consume other ships to boost the stats of a given ship.
- Only use common (gray) ships. Higher rarity ships should be retired for 'Medals' instead.

### Retrofit

- Retrofitting allows you to 'rebirth' your ship to a modernized version with an upgrade in rarity and greatly improved stats.
- Only a limited number of ships can be retrofitted.
- Retrofit blueprints are required and can be obtained from [Hard Mode](#hard-mode) maps.

### Leveling

- Basic leveling mechanics:
    * You will receive reduced exp for fighting very low-level ships.
    * Your leveling efficiency highly depends on oil. Smaller ships use less oil. Usually the cost (greatest to lowest) is as follows: Battleships > Battlecruisers > Carriers > Light Carriers/Heavy Cruisers > Light Cruisers > Destroyers.
    * Limit breaking a ship will increase its oil cost.
- EXP bonuses (bonuses stack multiplicatively):
    * Base XP is the amount given for A rank. Achieving a S rank gives 1.2x EXP.
    * Ships that are 'Very Happy' (120 or more Morale) earn 1.2x EXP. Ships that are 'Sad' earn 0.5x EXP.
    * The Flagship (middle backline) earns 1.5x EXP.
    * The ships that earns MVP earns 2x EXP.
    * Certain ships give EXP bonus buffs to certain hull classes (e.g. Amazon gives 6-18% to destroyers).
